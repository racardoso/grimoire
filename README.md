A repository for my utility scripts

## HHVM kleenex

cmake/make do a pretty lousy job when clean HHVM sometimes it give us build 
errors especially with Hack. So this script make a nice clean on HHVM before 
build again

## PPC64 Encoder/Decoder script

A simple convenience script to encode ou decode a PPC64 instruction. You can 
pass a instruction literal and encode and print the instruction image or pass a 
instruction image and it will decode the instruction printing the instruction 
literal.
